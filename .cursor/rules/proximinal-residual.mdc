For problems of the form

$$
\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \; f(x) + g(x)
$$

where f is smooth and g is convex (possibly non-smooth), the proximal residual at xk is defined as

$$
r^k := \tfrac{1}{\alpha} \Big( x^k - \operatorname{prox}_{\alpha g}\!\big(x^k - \alpha \nabla f(x^k)\big) \Big)
$$

In the special case when g = δC for a convex set C, the proximal residual is call the projected gradient and it reads

$$
g^k := \tfrac{1}{\alpha} \Big( x^k - \Pi_{C}\!\big(x^k - \alpha \nabla f(x^k)\big) \Big)
$$

where ΠC denotes the projection onto the set C.
