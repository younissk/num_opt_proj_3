# Task 3: Condition number of matrix A and pre-conditioning

Vandermonde matrices are known to be ill-conditioned, especially for large degrees n or when
the evaluation points aj are close together, which can cause numerical instability in polynomial
approximation problems. compute the condition number of A for various n pre-conditioning: divide each column of A by its norm and compute the condition number again find a diagonal matrix D such that the above operation (column normalization) corresponds to multiplying A with D−1 how to use the normalized version of A?

Define new variables  ̃x = Dx (i.e. x = D−1  ̃x) and rewrite both Lasso problems in terms of  ̃x.
Be carefull about how the constraints/nonsmooth part changes!
