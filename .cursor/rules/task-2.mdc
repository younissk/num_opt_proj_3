# Task 2: Apply the FB to the penalized Lasso and the PG as well as the AMS to the constrained Lasso

Apply the FB to the penalized Lasso and the PG as well as the AMS to the constrained Lasso.

For AMS, reformulate the constraints like in P2.

Try different sizes of n (up to 15), starting points, and parameters λ.

Report the number of iterates needed and the optimality measure. Plot the graphs of resulting approximations as well as of the function sin(t) over [−2π, 2π]. Based on the optimality measure and the plots, comment on how good is the approximation.
